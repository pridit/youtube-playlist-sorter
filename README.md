## YouTube Playlist Sorter

By default YouTube sorts the display of playlists by usage. This Firefox extension overrides that behaviour to be alphabetical (A-Z) in both the main sidebar, and the selection modal that is brought up when deciding which playlist(s) to add a video to.

>While a few Google Chrome extensions exist to support this behaviour, there were none for Firefox and such requests seemingly fell on deaf ears.
