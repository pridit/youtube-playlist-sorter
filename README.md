## YouTube Playlist Sorter

By default YouTube sorts the order of playlists by activity. This Firefox extension overrides that behaviour to be alphabetical (A-Z) in the selection modal.

> [!NOTE]
> While a few Google Chrome extensions exist to support this behaviour, there were none for Firefox and such requests seemingly fell on deaf ears. This extension has been created primarily for my own use case and as such support/future changes (e.g. fixing in the event of design changes) may or may not happen.
